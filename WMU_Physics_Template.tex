%% Spacing-----------------------%-------------------------------
%% The default document line spacing is single-space.  Double spacing is typical for thesis 
%  submission.  Two types of double spacing are available: 'typewriter' double spacing, which 
%  leaves a full line of space between two lines of text; and 'word processor' double spacing, 
%  which separates each line of text by about about 1.6 lines.  Set double spacing below.
